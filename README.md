# Unsupervised Learning
This repository contains various unsupervised learning algorithms implemented from scratch. In the pdf document there is a full comparison of their performances using the Iris datset as baseline.

# Algorithms:
- Subtractive Clustering
- Mountain Clustering
- Fuzzy c-Means
- KMeans
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Distance Clustering
- Connected Components (a simple algorithm that I invented based on the idea of the connected components in a graph)

# Setting up the environment
To set up your virtual environment, use the command "bash setup.sh".

# Running the program
To run the program, simply use python main.py. Remember that you have to set up 
the environment first, or it will probably throw an error.
