# Unsupervised Learning
This repository contains various unsupervised learning algorithms.

# Set Up
To set up your virtual environment, use the command "./setup.sh".

# Running the program
To run the program, simply use python main.py. Remember that you have to set up 
the environment first, or it will probably throw an error.

# Algorithms
## KNN clustering
This algorithm computes the K-nearest neighbors for every point in the dataset. It is 
a soft clustering algorithm since it is possible that the clusters it generates 
share points, which means the clusters are not disjoint.
This function has a hyperparameter "K", which you can tweak in the parameters.json
file.
